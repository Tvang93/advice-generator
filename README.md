# Peer Review
>Great job. As far as I can tell you successfully recreated the advice generator design. Everything functions as it should. Great job with responsiveness. That being said, here are some nitpicks for you to consider. You might want to change your alt attributes to be a little more accurate. You might be able to replace the text-xs class with using the small html tag, although that wouldn't neccessarily be best practices. Maybe consider using the q html quote tag to get those differently styled quotation marks. Interesting use of import for the file paths to your images. I didn't know you could do that. An alternative way is to use the hidden and block classes. Overall looks spot on! Great work!
